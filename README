A program to demonstrate the plotting of a useable psychometric chart 
using R.

The neccessary psycrometric functions are included in the script to 
minimize dependecies.

I have added chart4.R which is much easier to use than chart2.R. It
automatically calculates a lot of things like labels and label positions.  
USAGE : Go to user parameters section near the top of the script. Enter
as R variables as indicated.


USAGE chart2.R : Just running the script should generate the default chart.
To make your own chart just copy the script to a useful name and
edit it as you wish.

The curves are easy to draw but getting the labels properly positioned
and angled is tedious and makes the script much less practical.  I am
currently working on expanding the script to automate this functionality.
